0.133 Tue Aug  7 22:31:33 CEST 2001

	- Serial transport now waites for the GSM modem to come up. It will
	  read out the SIM card ( phonebook? ) when first coming up, and
	  this could cause some trouble. Thanks to Warwick Smith for fixing
	  this.

0.131 Mon Aug  6 23:11:59 CEST 2001
	- Updated NBS.pm and Transport.pm. Now the return value from
	  the Trnsport subsystem really gets into the upper API.
	  Thanks to Warwick Smith for pointing this one out to me.

0.13 Tue Jul 24 22:45:37 CEST 2001
	- Updated examples/slashdot/slashdot to be verbose
	  on not being able to send. Using the new return
	  values from GSM::SMS::NBS.

	 Sat Jul 21 17:57:11 CEST 2001
	- Changed the return value in NBS.pm of all functions.
	  The return value was 'hardwired' to -1, meaning success.
	  Now this value has changed to the C convention:
	 	-1 means failure.
		 0 means success.
	  ( This oddity needs to get in the release documentation,
        as it can break existing implementations. )

0.12 Sat Jul 14 23:27:00 CEST 2001
	- Adding support for an XmlRpc node transport.
	  This transport is application specific, it used by the
	  mercury project, a small SMS Messaging Server build
	  on top of the GSM::SMS package.

0.11 Sat Jul 14 20:52:24 CEST 2001
	- MCube (www.mcube.be) support for text messages implemented
	  Binary support does not seem to work correctly for now.
	- Implemented optimised delete for Serial transport.
	  Attributed by Toni Mattila <tontsa@asiaonline.net.my>.
	- New config parameter for Serial transport:
		memorylimit	= nn
		( nn = 10 for WaveCom, nn = 15 for Siemens C25 )
	  Pointed out by Toni Mattila <tontsa@asiaonline.net.my>

0.0  Sun Jun  3 21:46:04 2001

		-XA -n GSM::SMS
	- used the iSMS library modules and put them in another base
	  directory (class path). ( Tektonica::iSMS -> GSM::SMS ). I did this
	  to able to release them on CPAN.
