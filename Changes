Revision history for Perl extension GSM::SMS.

	Wed Feb  5 00:21:55 PST 2003
	- It seems that the background issue of the images is related to the
	  new release of ImageMagick, which seems to invert some monochrome
	  images with no apparent reason. I solved this  by extending the test 
	  cases and take in account a normal and an inverted image.
	- I merged Marcel Brouillet's patch for the background of images. Black is
	  now always background, white is foreground.

	Sat Jan 11 15:21:17 PST 2003
	- Now I set the version of all modules to the one specified in the
	  Makefile.PL before release (make setversion). 

	Thu Jan  9 22:56:16 PST 2003
	- t/5* tests now correctly set the image format to gif.
	- lib/GSM/SMS/OTA/Bitmap.pm now sets the fore and background color
	  explicitly, as it seemed that on some systems the logos would be inverted.
	  (Thanks Marcel Brouillet for finding this bug)
	- lib/GSM/SMS/OTA/PictureMessage.pm now puts the correct length of the
	  text data in the stream (Thanks Daniel Podlejski for sending me a fix).

	Mon Dec 30 03:14:04 PST 2002
	- AT+CREG can return a 5 on success (roaming), Serial.pm now supports this.
	  (pointed out by Scott Guthery)
	- RTTTL can contain the values P, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, H.
	  GSM::SMS::OTA::RTTTL::OTARTTTL_check() now uses these values. (Thanks Philip
	  Yara for pointing this out).

0.160 Tue Dec 24 00:36:06 PST 2002
	- Win32 compatibility for GSM::SMS, Win32 defaults in configuration
	- Autogenerating README
	- Bug in GSM::SMS::Config::_config_wizard prevented creation of directories

	Mon Dec  9 00:12:10 PST 2002
	- Added a test for the acessors (t/22_transport_accessor)
	- GSM::SMS::Transport::get_transports now returns an array instead of
	  an array ref.

	Sat Dec  7 18:37:52 PST 2002
	- Added an accessor to GSM::SMS::NBS to access the GSM::SMS::Transport object
	- Added a method to get a transport object by name to GSM::SMS::Transport
	  (get_transport_by_name)

	Sat Nov 23 19:58:51 PST 2002
	- Makefile.PL appended Config/Default.pm, no just writes it out
	- t/03_transport_serial.t now uses the correct parameters for serial
	  object.
	- Config.pm mistakingly used 'pin-code' instead of 'pin_code'. The same
	  for baud_rate, serial_port

	Fri Nov 22 21:03:22 PST 2002
	- Added an extra parameter to NBS::SendSMSTextMessage for flash messages.
	- Added 4 constant definitions to NBS:
	    FLASH_YES, FLASH_NO, MULTIPART_YES, MULTIPART_NO

	Thu Oct 17 21:56:20 PDT 2002
	- GSM::SMS should be Win32 compatible now.
	- bin directory contains the first 'app', GSsend_text

	Sun Sep 29 21:36:57 PDT 2002
	- Changed the complete layout of the directory
	   <project>/lib
	   <project>/bin
	   <project>/t
	   <project>/docs
	   <project>/examples
	- Term::ReadLine is no more for Makefile.PL, using ExtUtils::MakeMaker
      prompt instead.
	- perl -MGSM::SMS::Config -egenerate_config generates a config file
	  form the default configuration.
	- Minor doc update in NBS.pm

	- CONFIGURE hook in Makefile.PL fixed for 5.8.0RC3

0.150 Sun Jul 14 14:47:39 CEST 2002
	- All unit tests pass
	- All example apps pass
	- Changed default loop in RTTTL.pm, got errors when loop not defined in
	  song string.

	  Thu Jul 11 21:23:21 CEST 2002
	- Added tests for all the NBS formats
	- Removed the newline from generated RTTTL streams
	
	  Wed Jul 10 18:56:54 CEST 2002
	- Got a version that passes the tests today.
	- Simple router now works as expected
	- Got rid of some annoying 'value not initialized' warnings
	- test_72x28.gif is now in 2 color format
	- Transport/File.pm now returns the correct value on succes 'sending'
	- Lot's of other bugfixes
	  
	  Sun Jul  7 13:46:30 CEST 2002
	- I've been debugging this week.
	- Lot's of small bugfixes

	  Tue Jul  2 21:20:47 CEST 2002
	- All the stuff below has been done over a timespan of 3 months,
	  made no Changes log entries
	- Refactored all the Transport classes 
	- Implemented a better routing facility. Routing is now done in
	  a separate class and expandable. A simple router has been implemented
	  GSM::SMS::TransportRouter::Simple. All is being driven by a
	  TransportRouterFactory  class.
	- All logging is now done via the Log::Agent framework from Mark Rogaski
	- GSM::SMS::NBS constructor can now accept a -transport and -config_file
	  argument.

	  Wed Apr 17 21:11:45 CEST 2002
	- RTTTL now supports looping, thanks to Joao Pedro Goncalves 
	  <joaop@co.sapo.pt>.
	- Configuration wizard when running perl Makefile.PL added.

	  Mon Feb 25 23:09:34 UTC 2002
	- Implemented the PictureMessage format.
	  
	  Sun Feb 24 18:13:53 UTC 2002
	- Decided to go for a separate living space for EMS messages.
	  This has consequences ... it is now clear that the OTA namespace
	  is wrongly chosen, but will be further used, only for NBS. For EMS
	  a better namespace lives within the EMS sub directory.
	- Changed the GSM::SMS::OTA::Bitmap class to support also a height of
	  28 pixels, as used in the Picture message format.

	  Thu Dec 20 22:44:59 CET 2001
	- Got a nice patch from David Wright. He fixed some bugs in the
	  code handling the ringtones (RTTTL.pm)
	- PDU.pm: Solved warning when doing test with Test::More
	- Transport.pm : Bails out properly now when a transport fails to load.

0.142 Wed Dec 12 23:13:04 CET 2001
	- Fixed the mysteriously vanishing of SMS messages from the GSM modem.
	  I can't reproduce the error anymore, since I fixed the 
	  TTL (Time To Live) in Stack.pm.

0.141 Sat Aug 18 16:11:35 CEST 2001
	- Fixed export of OTAOperatorlogo_from{file,b64} in GSM::SMS::OTA::
	  Operatorlogo.

0.14  Wed Aug  8 19:13:44 CEST 2001
	- Release for 1.4 

0.133 Tue Aug  7 22:31:33 CEST 2001
	- We now have MIDI support!
	  Added GSM::SMS::Support::RTTTL2MIDI, kindly donated by isminiz 
	  <ethemevlice@yahoo.com>. Based upon code from G.Babakhani ...

0.132 Tue Aug  7 20:03:30 CEST 2001
	- Serial transport now waites for the GSM modem to come up. It will
	  read out the SIM card ( phonebook? ) when first coming up, and
	  this could cause some trouble. Thanks to Warwick Smith for fixing
	  this.

0.131 Mon Aug  6 23:11:59 CEST 2001
	- Updated NBS.pm and Transport.pm. Now the return value from
	  the Trnsport subsystem really gets into the upper API.
	  Thanks to Warwick Smith for pointing this one out to me.

0.13 Tue Jul 24 22:45:37 CEST 2001
	- Updated examples/slashdot/slashdot to be verbose
	  on not being able to send. Using the new return
	  values from GSM::SMS::NBS.

	 Sat Jul 21 17:57:11 CEST 2001
	- Changed the return value in NBS.pm of all functions.
	  The return value was 'hardwired' to -1, meaning success.
	  Now this value has changed to the C convention:
	 	-1 means failure.
		 0 means success.
	  ( This oddity needs to get in the release documentation,
        as it can break existing implementations. )

0.12 Sat Jul 14 23:27:00 CEST 2001
	- Adding support for an XmlRpc node transport.
	  This transport is application specific, it used by the
	  mercury project, a small SMS Messaging Server build
	  on top of the GSM::SMS package.

0.11 Sat Jul 14 20:52:24 CEST 2001
	- MCube (www.mcube.be) support for text messages implemented
	  Binary support does not seem to work correctly for now.
	- Implemented optimised delete for Serial transport.
	  Attributed by Toni Mattila <tontsa@asiaonline.net.my>.
	- New config parameter for Serial transport:
		memorylimit	= nn
		( nn = 10 for WaveCom, nn = 15 for Siemens C25 )
	  Pointed out by Toni Mattila <tontsa@asiaonline.net.my>

0.1  Sun Jun 17 01:06:12 2001
	- Preparing launch on CPAN
	- added documentation and examples

0.0  Sun Jun  3 21:46:04 2001
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-XA -n GSM::SMS
	- used the iSMS library modules and put them in another base
	  directory (class path). ( Tektonica::iSMS -> GSM::SMS ). I did this
	  to able to release them on CPAN.
