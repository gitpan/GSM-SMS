Revision history for Perl extension GSM::SMS.

0.13 Tue Jul 24 22:45:37 CEST 2001
	- Updated examples/slashdot/slashdot to be verbose
	  on not being able to send. Using the new return
	  values from GSM::SMS::NBS.

	 Sat Jul 21 17:57:11 CEST 2001
	- Changed the return value in NBS.pm of all functions.
	  The return value was 'hardwired' to -1, meaning success.
	  Now this value has changed to the C convention:
	 	-1 means failure.
		 0 means success.
	  ( This oddity needs to get in the release documentation,
        as it can break existing implementations. )

0.12 Sat Jul 14 23:27:00 CEST 2001
	- Adding support for an XmlRpc node transport.
	  This transport is application specific, it used by the
	  mercury project, a small SMS Messaging Server build
	  on top of the GSM::SMS package.

0.11 Sat Jul 14 20:52:24 CEST 2001
	- MCube (www.mcube.be) support for text messages implemented
	  Binary support does not seem to work correctly for now.
	- Implemented optimised delete for Serial transport.
	  Attributed by Toni Mattila <tontsa@asiaonline.net.my>.
	- New config parameter for Serial transport:
		memorylimit	= nn
		( nn = 10 for WaveCom, nn = 15 for Siemens C25 )
	  Pointed out by Toni Mattila <tontsa@asiaonline.net.my>
